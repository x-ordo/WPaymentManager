## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 - BLOCKS US1
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Depends on Phase 2 (AWS infrastructure)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Depends on Phase 3 (needs AI-processed data for realistic testing)
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Can start after Phase 1 - independent
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: Can start after Phase 1 - independent
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: Can start after Phase 1 - independent
- **Phase 8 (US6)**: Can start after Phase 1 - independent (but recommend after US1)
- **Phase 9 (Polish)**: Depends on all user stories complete

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Can Parallelize With |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| US1 (AI Worker) | Phase 2 (AWS) | - |
| US2 (RAG/Draft) | US1 (needs data) | - |
| US3 (Error Handling) | Phase 1 only | US4, US5, US6 |
| US4 (CI Tests) | Phase 1 only | US3, US5, US6 |
| US5 (Permissions) | Phase 1 only | US3, US4, US6 |
| US6 (Deployment) | Phase 1 only | US3, US4, US5 |

### Within Each User Story

1. Configuration/setup tasks first
2. Implementation tasks second
3. Verification/test tasks last
4. All [P] marked tasks can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (AWS)**:
```
T005 (dev bucket) || T006 (prod bucket) - parallel
T008 (dev notification) || T009 (prod notification) - parallel
```

**Phase 5-7 (US3, US4, US5)** can run entirely in parallel:
```
US3 Frontend Error Handling
US4 CI Test Coverage
US5 Permissions
```

**Within US3**:
```
T023 (toast in client) || T024 (useRetry hook) - parallel
```

**Within US4**:
```
T029 (backend threshold) || T030 (ai_worker threshold) - parallel
T032 (draft tests) || T033 (search tests) || T034 (qdrant tests) - parallel
```

**Within US5**:
```
T037 (cases audit) || T038 (evidence audit) || T039 (drafts audit) - parallel
```

---

## Parallel Example: US3 + US4 + US5

```bash
# These three user stories can run in parallel after Phase 1

# Developer A: US3 Frontend Error Handling
Task: "Install react-hot-toast: cd frontend && npm install react-hot-toast"
Task: "Add Toaster component to frontend/src/app/layout.tsx"

# Developer B: US4 CI Tests
Task: "Update backend coverage threshold to 70% in backend/pytest.ini"
Task: "Add unit tests for draft_service.py in backend/tests/unit/test_draft_service.py"

# Developer C: US5 Permissions
Task: "Audit /cases/* endpoints for permission checks in backend/app/api/cases.py"
Task: "Add audit_log write for ACCESS_DENIED in backend/app/services/audit_log_service.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (US1 + US2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (verification)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (AWS infrastructure)
3. Complete Phase 3: US1 (AI Worker operational)
4. Complete Phase 4: US2 (RAG/Draft functional)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test full evidence upload → draft generation flow
6. Deploy to staging for demo

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Week 1**: Phase 1-3 (Setup → AWS → US1) → AI Worker operational
2. **Week 2**: Phase 4-6 (US2, US3, US4) in parallel → Core features + quality
3. **Week 3**: Phase 7-8 (US5, US6) → Security + deployment
4. **Week 4**: Phase 9 (Polish) → Production ready

### Single Developer Strategy

Execute in priority order:
1. T001-T010: Setup + AWS (2-3 hours)
2. T011-T015: US1 verification (1 hour)
3. T016-T020: US2 verification (1 hour)
4. T021-T028: US3 error handling (3-4 hours)
5. T029-T036: US4 CI tests (4-6 hours)
6. T037-T043: US5 permissions (3-4 hours)
7. T044-T050: US6 deployment (2-3 hours)
8. T051-T055: Polish (2 hours)

**Total estimated time**: 20-25 hours

## Notes

- Most code is already implemented (70-100% complete per user story)
- Focus is on configuration, verification, and polish
- AWS tasks (Phase 2) require appropriate IAM permissions
- CI tasks (US4) may require running tests locally first to identify gaps
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Create PR after each user story for review
