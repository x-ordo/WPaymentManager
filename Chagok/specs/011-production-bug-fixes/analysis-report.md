**Overall Assessment**: Feature documentation is **well-structured** with minor gaps. Recommended to address Medium severity items before closing the feature.

---

## 1. Inconsistency Detection

### INC-001: Task Status Mismatch (MEDIUM)

**Location**: tasks.md vs actual implementation

**Issue**: tasks.md shows T055-T058 (Unit Tests) as `[ ]` (pending), but these tests have been implemented and committed.

**Affected Tasks**:
- `[ ] T055 [P] [US2] Unit tests for NotificationDropdown` → Actually DONE
- `[ ] T056 [P] [US2] Unit tests for MessageList` → Actually DONE
- `[ ] T057 [P] [US2] Unit tests for ClientForm` → Actually DONE
- `[ ] T058 [P] [US2] Unit tests for DetectiveForm` → Actually DONE

**Recommendation**: Update tasks.md to mark T055-T058 as `[x]` completed.

---

### INC-002: Task Count Mismatch (LOW)

**Location**: tasks.md Task Summary table

**Issue**: Summary table shows:
- Phase 2: US1 = 16 tasks (T006-T021)
- But T014-T017 are marked `[N/A]` (not needed)

**Impact**: Total count inaccurate (62 total, but 4 are N/A)

**Recommendation**: Update Task Summary to reflect accurate counts:
- Phase 2: US1 = 12 active tasks (16 - 4 N/A)
- Total = 58 active tasks (62 - 4 N/A)

---

### INC-003: Phase Number Mismatch (LOW)

**Location**: plan.md vs tasks.md

**Issue**:
- plan.md defines **5 phases** (Phase 1-5)
- tasks.md defines **4 phases** (Phase 1-4)

**Details**:
| plan.md Phase | tasks.md Phase |
|---------------|----------------|
| Phase 1: Login Bug | Phase 2: US1 |
| Phase 2: Notifications | Phase 3: US2 |
| Phase 3: Messages | Phase 3: US2 |
| Phase 4: Client/Detective | Phase 3: US2 |
| Phase 5: Dashboard | Phase 3: US2 |

**Impact**: plan.md granular phases collapsed into US-based grouping in tasks.md

**Recommendation**: This is acceptable (tasks grouped by User Story). Add a note in tasks.md explaining the mapping.

---

## 2. Duplication Detection

### DUP-001: Repeated Cookie Configuration Details (LOW)

**Location**: research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Issue**: Cookie configuration requirements (`SameSite=None`, `Secure=true`) documented in 3 places:
- research.md lines 58-62, 127-131
- data-model.md lines 126-155
- quickstart.md lines 29-38

**Impact**: Risk of inconsistent updates

**Recommendation**: Consider consolidating into a single reference in data-model.md and linking from other docs.

---

### DUP-002: Entity Definitions Repeated (LOW)

**Location**: data-model.md, contracts/*.yaml

**Issue**: Client, Detective, Message, Notification entities defined in both:
- data-model.md (Python models + TypeScript DTOs)
- contracts/*.yaml (OpenAPI schemas)

**Impact**: Maintenance burden when schema changes

**Recommendation**: This duplication is **intentional and acceptable** (data model = source of truth, contracts = API spec). Ensure consistency during updates.

---

## 3. Ambiguity Detection

### AMB-001: "Polling (5분 간격)" Implementation Unclear (LOW)

**Location**: research.md line 233, spec.md FR-007

**Issue**: spec.md FR-007 states "알림 버튼 클릭 시 드롭다운 표시" but doesn't specify polling interval. research.md mentions "5분 간격" but this is a decision, not a requirement.

**Impact**: Implementation might not match intended behavior

**Recommendation**: Add FR-007a: "알림은 5분 간격으로 자동 갱신된다" if polling is required, or clarify that polling is optional future enhancement.

---

## 4. Underspecification Detection

### UND-001: Backend Tasks Missing GitHub Issue Reference (MEDIUM)

**Location**: tasks.md T022-T026

**Issue**: Tasks mention "GitHub Issues: #294-#298" but lack direct links or verification that these issues exist and are properly assigned.

**Recommendation**: Verify issues exist:
```bash
gh issue list --repo x-ordo/CHAGOK --label "011-production-bug-fixes"
```

---

### UND-002: E2E Test Coverage for US2 Missing (MEDIUM)

**Location**: tasks.md Phase 3

**Issue**: US1 has E2E tests (T006-T008), but US2 (Lawyer Portal features) has no E2E test tasks defined.

**Impact**: US2 features (notifications, messages, clients, detectives) lack end-to-end verification.

**Recommendation**: Add tasks:
- T063: E2E test for notification dropdown interaction
- T064: E2E test for message CRUD flow
- T065: E2E test for client/detective management

---

### UND-003: Error Handling Not Specified (MEDIUM)

**Location**: spec.md, contracts/*.yaml

**Issue**: API contracts define success responses but error responses are inconsistent:
- notifications-api.yaml: Has 401, 403
- messages-api.yaml: Missing error responses
- clients-api.yaml: Has 400, 404
- detectives-api.yaml: Missing error responses

**Impact**: Frontend error handling may be incomplete

**Recommendation**: Standardize error responses across all contracts:
- 400: Validation error
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Not found
- 500: Server error

---

### UND-004: Manual Verification Tasks Incomplete (LOW)

**Location**: tasks.md T018-T021

**Issue**: Manual verification tasks are marked `[ ]` (pending) even though US1 has been verified and PR created.

**Recommendation**: If manual tests were performed, mark T018-T021 as complete with verification notes.

---

## 5. Coverage Gap Analysis

### GAP-001: FR-014 (Case CRUD) Task Mapping Missing (MEDIUM)

**Location**: spec.md FR-014, tasks.md

**Issue**: spec.md defines:
- FR-014: 케이스 CRUD가 동작해야 한다

But tasks.md has no explicit task for Case CRUD verification. Cases are assumed to work from previous features.

**Recommendation**: Add verification task or mark FR-014 as "Verified in previous feature (009-mvp-gap-closure)".

---

### GAP-002: Success Criteria SC-003 Verification Missing (LOW)

**Location**: spec.md SC-003, tasks.md

**Issue**: SC-003 states "로그인부터 대시보드 도달까지 3초 이내" but no task measures this metric.

**Recommendation**: Add to T018: "(observe timing, must be <3s)" or create separate performance verification task.
