# Feature Specification: UI Upgrade

**Feature Branch**: `013-ui-upgrade`
**Created**: 2025-12-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ui-upgrade"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Design System Consistency (Priority: P1)

Users experience a consistent, professional visual design across all pages of the CHAGOK, building trust and reducing cognitive load when working with sensitive legal matters.

**Why this priority**: Design inconsistency erodes user trust in a legal application. Lawyers and staff need a polished, predictable interface when handling divorce evidence. This is foundational for all other UI improvements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating through all major application areas (landing page, lawyer portal, case detail, evidence management) and verifying visual consistency in colors, typography, spacing, and component styling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user navigates through the application, **When** they move between different pages (landing, dashboard, cases, evidence), **Then** they see consistent colors, typography, and component styling throughout.
2. **Given** multiple buttons appear on any page, **When** the user views buttons of the same type, **Then** they have identical styling (colors, sizes, hover effects) regardless of which page they are on.
3. **Given** the application uses a design system, **When** all legacy color references are removed, **Then** only semantic design tokens (primary, secondary, success, warning, error) are used throughout.

### User Story 2 - Responsive Mobile Experience (Priority: P2)

Lawyers and staff can effectively use the application on tablets and mobile devices when away from their desks, allowing them to review evidence and case updates while in court or meeting clients.

**Why this priority**: Legal professionals are frequently mobile - in court, client meetings, or working from home. Mobile access enables productivity in various contexts without being tied to a desktop.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the application on mobile (or mobile emulator) and completing core workflows: viewing case list, accessing case details, reviewing evidence, and navigating between sections.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the application on a mobile device (320px width), **When** they view any page, **Then** content is readable without horizontal scrolling and touch targets are appropriately sized (minimum 44x44px).
2. **Given** a user on a tablet (768px width), **When** they interact with data tables, **Then** tables adapt to show essential columns with option to view additional details.
3. **Given** a lawyer in court using their phone, **When** they need to quickly check case details, **Then** critical information (case name, status, recent updates) is immediately visible without excessive scrolling.

### User Story 3 - Loading States and Feedback (Priority: P3)

Users receive clear visual feedback during all asynchronous operations (data loading, file uploads, AI processing), reducing uncertainty and preventing duplicate actions.

**Why this priority**: Legal evidence processing involves AI analysis that takes time. Clear feedback prevents users from wondering if the system is working and from accidentally triggering duplicate operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering async operations (page load, evidence upload, AI analysis) and verifying appropriate loading indicators appear and disappear correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a page is loading data, **When** the request is in progress, **Then** a skeleton loader or spinner is displayed in the content area.
2. **Given** a user uploads evidence files, **When** the upload is processing, **Then** they see progress indication and cannot accidentally trigger duplicate uploads.
3. **Given** an operation fails, **When** an error occurs, **Then** users see a clear error message with guidance on next steps (retry, contact support, etc.).

---

### User Story 4 - Empty States and Onboarding (Priority: P3)

New users and users with empty data sets see helpful, contextual guidance instead of blank screens, improving first-time user experience and reducing support requests.

**Why this priority**: Empty states are often the first experience for new users. Helpful guidance at these moments sets expectations and teaches users how to use the system effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing pages with no data (new case with no evidence, new user with no cases) and verifying helpful empty state messages appear with clear calls-to-action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a lawyer has no cases assigned, **When** they view the cases page, **Then** they see a helpful message explaining how to create or be assigned to a case.
2. **Given** a case has no evidence uploaded, **When** viewing the evidence section, **Then** users see guidance on how to upload evidence with clear upload button.
3. **Given** a new staff member logs in for the first time, **When** they access their dashboard, **Then** they see an onboarding state with quick-start guidance.

### User Story 5 - Accessibility Compliance (Priority: P2)

All users, including those with disabilities or using assistive technologies, can fully navigate and operate the application in compliance with accessibility standards.

**Why this priority**: Legal services must be accessible to all users. Additionally, many law firms have accessibility requirements for their tools. This also improves usability for all users (keyboard navigation, screen reader support).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running automated accessibility tests (axe, lighthouse) and performing manual keyboard navigation and screen reader testing on key workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user navigates using only keyboard, **When** they tab through interactive elements, **Then** focus is visible and logical, and all functionality is accessible.
2. **Given** a screen reader user accesses the application, **When** they navigate through pages, **Then** content is announced in a logical order with appropriate labels and roles.
3. **Given** any color contrast requirements, **When** reviewing all text and interactive elements, **Then** contrast ratios meet minimum requirements for readability.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when users have slow network connections?
  - *Show graceful degradation with persistent loading states; avoid blank screens*
- How does the system handle theme switching (light/dark)?
  - *Theme transitions smoothly without flash of unstyled content*
- What if a user's browser doesn't support CSS variables?
  - *Provide fallback values; gracefully degrade to default styling*
- How are very long case names or evidence titles displayed?
  - *Truncate with ellipsis and show full text on hover/focus via tooltip*

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST apply consistent visual styling (colors, typography, spacing) across all pages using the established design token system.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all pages correctly on viewports from 320px to 1920px width without horizontal scrolling.
- **FR-003**: System MUST show loading indicators during all asynchronous operations (data fetching, file upload, AI processing).
- **FR-004**: System MUST display contextual empty states with guidance when data collections are empty.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support keyboard-only navigation for all interactive features.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide appropriate ARIA labels and roles for screen reader compatibility.
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain color contrast ratios that meet accessibility standards.
- **FR-008**: System MUST disable or visually indicate buttons/forms during submission to prevent duplicate actions.
- **FR-009**: System MUST display error states with clear messaging when operations fail.

- **SC-002**: All pages load with visible feedback (loading state) within perceptible time, with content appearing progressively.
- **SC-003**: Keyboard-only users can navigate through all interactive elements in logical order.
- **SC-004**: Screen reader users can understand and operate all core features without visual reference.
- **SC-005**: 100% of legacy color aliases are replaced with semantic design tokens.
- **SC-006**: Empty state guidance is present on all data-driven pages when no data exists.
- **SC-007**: No user-reported visual inconsistencies across the application after upgrade.
- **SC-008**: Theme switching works without page reload or content flash.

## Scope

**Focus Area**: Core Lawyer Portal

This UI upgrade focuses on lawyer-facing pages where most daily work happens:
- **Cases list and detail pages** - Primary case management interface
- **Evidence management** - Upload, review, and organize evidence
- **Draft generation and preview** - AI-assisted document drafting
- **Case relationship graph** - Party and relationship visualization
- **Shared components** - Navigation, modals, tables, and forms used across these pages

This targeted scope covers approximately 40 components and delivers the highest value by improving the daily workflow experience for lawyers and legal staff.

## Assumptions

1. **Existing design system is the foundation**: The upgrade builds on the existing CSS variable-based design token system rather than replacing it.
2. **Dark mode is already functional**: The upgrade improves theme implementation but doesn't need to build dark mode from scratch.
3. **Pretendard font remains**: Typography uses the existing Pretendard font family.
4. **No major UX flow changes**: This is a visual/polish upgrade, not a restructuring of navigation or user flows.
5. **Progressive enhancement**: Features work on modern browsers with graceful degradation for older browsers.
6. **Tailwind CSS continues**: Styling approach remains Tailwind-based with design tokens.
7. **Accessibility target is WCAG 2.1 AA**: Industry-standard accessibility compliance level.

## Out of Scope

- Major navigation restructuring or information architecture changes
- New features or functionality beyond visual/UX polish
- Performance optimization of backend/API (frontend-only focus)
- Content changes (copy, translations, help text authoring)
- New third-party component library adoption
