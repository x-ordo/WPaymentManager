# Tasks: Role-Based UI System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-role-based-ui/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, spec.md ✓
**Screen Reference**: `docs/screens/SCREEN_DEFINITION.md`

**Tests**: TDD approach requested. Test tasks included for each user story.

**TDD Cycle**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Write tests FIRST (they must FAIL initially)
- Implement minimum code to pass tests
- Refactor while tests stay GREEN

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 completion (role routing)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US2 completion (lawyer layout)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 completion (client role)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 completion (detective role)
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US4 and US5 (messaging between roles)
- **User Story 7 (Phase 9)**: Depends on US2 (lawyer portal)
- **User Story 8 (Phase 10)**: Depends on US4 (client billing view)
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### TDD Execution Order (Per User Story)

```
1. Write ALL tests for the user story (RED phase - tests FAIL)
2. Run tests to verify they FAIL correctly
3. Implement backend code (GREEN phase - tests pass)
4. Implement frontend code (GREEN phase - tests pass)
5. Refactor while keeping tests GREEN
6. Move to next user story
```

### User Story Dependencies

## Implementation Strategy

### TDD MVP First (US1 + US2 + US3)

1. **Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T004)
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational (T005-T010)
3. **US1 TDD Cycle**:
   - Write tests T011-T016 (RED - all fail)
   - Implement T017-T024 (GREEN - all pass)
4. **US2 TDD Cycle**:
   - Write tests T025-T028 (RED - all fail)
   - Implement T029-T038 (GREEN - all pass)
5. **US3 TDD Cycle**:
   - Write tests T039-T042 (RED - all fail)
   - Implement T043-T054 (GREEN - all pass)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: All MVP tests GREEN, manual testing
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental TDD Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Environment ready
2. US1 TDD → Role system ready (Demo 1)
3. US2 + US3 TDD → Lawyer Portal MVP (Demo 2)
4. US4 TDD → Client Portal (Demo 3)
5. US5 TDD → Detective Portal (Demo 4)
6. US6 + US7 TDD → Cross-cutting features (Demo 5)
7. US8 TDD → Billing (Demo 6)

## Notes

- **TDD Cycle**: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR for each user story
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- All tests MUST fail before implementation begins
- Each user story is independently testable after completion
- MVP = US1 + US2 + US3 (Lawyer Portal)
- Korean UTF-8 support required for all UI text
- Commit after each TDD phase (tests, implementation, refactor)
