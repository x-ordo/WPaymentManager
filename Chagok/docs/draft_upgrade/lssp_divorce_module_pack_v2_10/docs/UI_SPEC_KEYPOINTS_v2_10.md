# UI Spec v2.10 — Keypoints (detail/case)

3-pane layout:
- Left: Evidence list (filter type/G1~G6/status)
- Center: Candidate cards (source-span preview, accept/reject/edit)
- Right: Canonical keypoints (accepted)

Rules:
- Draft Builder cannot use keypoints unless ACCEPTED + >=1 citation.
- Missing dates stay TODO until user confirms occurred_at.
