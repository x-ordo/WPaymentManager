# LSSP / CHAGOK Divorce Module Pack v2.10
Focus: Keypoint Extraction Pipeline (Evidence -> Keypoints -> Checklist/Drafts/Issues)

This pack adds a deterministic, reviewable keypoint pipeline:
1) Evidence upload
2) Extract candidates (rule-based) + link to source span
3) Human confirm/merge -> Keypoints
4) Downstream links:
   - Evidence Checklist satisfaction
   - Draft Builder citations / block completion
   - Issues Dashboard scoring
